Service Sharing Facility (SSF)
==============================

INSTALLING THE PYOCCI MODULE
----------------------------
Simply running 'python setup.py install' Should do. Prerequisites for the
pyocci module are pretty low - You just need to ensure that you have the
tornado web part installed. 

RUNNING EXAMPLES
----------------
Simply use the 'demo.sh' script in the root directory.

BUILDING ALL SSF MODULES
------------------------
Normally a 'python setup_ssf.py build' should do. The 'dist' target will also 
work and build all modules including the SWIG and GCC runs needed for pyLSF. 
There is no need to run make. Although you can build the pyLSF module using the 
Makefile if you want. 

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Needed to build and install SSF:

  * Swig
  * Python (> 2.6) with distutils
  * GCC
  * Platform LSF (>= 7.0.6) (with lsf-drmaa (>=1.0.3 installed)) or 
    Oracle Grid Engine (>= 6.2u5)
  * drmaa-python
  * tornado web

For developing with SSF you can use:

  * Sphinx for building documents (python-sphinx)
  * python-coverage for creating coverage reports
  * epydoc for generation of API documentation
  * Eclipse with PyDev for coding or Aptana
  * Nosetest for easy unit testing (python-nose)
  * Firefox to view the kanban board (misc/spa_pyssf_kanban.html)
  * make to build standalone documentation and pylsf shared library

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------
The following paths are configured and you might need to take a look at them
if you encounter any problems:

  * library_dirs in setup.py which should point to the lib dir of the Platform
    LSF installation (Default set to /opt/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib)

  * include statements in lsf.i in the pylsf module - Should point to the
    concrete files in the Platform LSF installation. (Defaults set to 
    /opt/lsf/7.0/include/lsf/lsf.h and /opt/lsf/7.0/include/lsf/lsbatch.h)

  * The library directory in the Makefile of the pyLSF module if you want to 
    build it stand alone. No need to change it when building using setup.py 
    script. Default is set to /opt/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib. 

  * The unittest expect that there are no jobs pending in the queue of LSF.
    Overall this system is best test on a single machine cluster with an empty
    queue.

TESTING
-------
Either run nosetests or the testsuite.py file in the tests/ directory. You 
might need to add the build _lsf.so file to the PYTHONPATH (In my case: 
build/lib.linux-i686-2.6/pylsf)
